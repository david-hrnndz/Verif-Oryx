curve448SetInt
    - Done.
curve448Add
    - In progress (specified, proving loop body)
      Mimic what was done in curve448AddInt with the is_big and added_list functions.
curve448AddInt
    - In progress (proved loop body!)
      Perform a forward_call once Red is done. 
curve448Sub
    - Not done.
      Mimic what was done in curve448Add. Do curve448SubInt first. 
curve448SubInt
    - Not done.
      Mimic what was done in curve448AddInt.
curve448Mul
    - Not done.
      Hard. Do curve448MulInt first.
curve448MulInt
    - Not done.
      Hard.
curve448Sqr
    - Not done.
      Easy after curve448Mul is done. Simple forward_call.
curve448Pwr2
    - Not done.
      Somehwat easy after curve448Sqr is done. 
      Hard part might be the loop invariant.
curve448Red
    - In progress (specified, proving loop body). 
curve448Inv
    - Not done.
      Should be many forward_calls. 
curve448Sqrt
    - Not done.
      Should be many forward_calls.

    - Done. 
curve448Swap
    - Done. 
curve448Select
    - Done. 
curve448Comp
    - Done.
